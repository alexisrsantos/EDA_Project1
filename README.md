This repository contains my submission for Project 1 in the Exploratory Data Analysis administered by Coursera. 

# What will you find here?
* Code - Codes used to produce each Figure are named as requested (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R,plot4.R)

Simply said, in this repository you will find 4 code files and 4 plots.
